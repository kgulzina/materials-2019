# Text files versus binary files

- text files are all formats that are humanly readable, i.e. we can open the files in a text editor and read the contents

- binary files encode contents in a machine readable form

- What are the pros and cons?

# Text files and R

- base R supports reading text files, e.g. `read.table(), read.csv(), read.delim()` reads data from  text files files with specified delimiters 

- `write.table()` writes  text files files

- the `readr` package provides similar functionality: `read_csv, read_tsv, read_delim`

- `readr` functions are faster than base R functions, if the whole file is being read at once

- all of the text files have to be highly structured to be readable


---

## Binary files and R

- `saveRDS()` saves a single R object in binary format, use extension `.rds`

- `readRDS()` reads R binary file

- `save()` saves all objects in a binary file (and keeps their names), use extension `.rda` 

- `load()` retrieves these objects (using the same names)

---

## Example

```{r}
system.time(d1 <- read.csv("../data/nasadata.csv"))
system.time(d2 <- readRDS("../data/nasadata.rds"))
```

speed-up is about factor 10 in favor of binary files


---

# Binary file formats

- No restriction in terms on content, streams of bytes

- Advantage: Generally much smaller files, and with compression even smaller, e.g. `nasadata.csv` is 3.7Mb, `nasadata.rds` is 288kb

- Disadvantage:  

    - introduce a dependency on software (what if in a future version of the software our old binary file cannot be read anymore?) 
    - potential of dependency on operating system
    - file corruption is not recoverable

---

# Text file formats

- humanly readable does not necessarily mean well-structured or nicely readable

- in R we are often dealing with csv, i.e. column separated values

- sometimes we deal with tsv (separated by tabulator)

- we will look at a few different file formats

---

# JSON

- JSON is short for JavaScript  Object Notation (http://json.org/) 

- it is a lightweight data interchange format, becoming increasingly popular

- Human readable and writable

- Utilized by many web APIs, e.g. tumblr, twitter, ... 


---

# JSON - example 

e.g. result from get query in JSON format:

```
 [{"P0010001":710231,"NAME":"Alaska","state":"02"},
 {"P0010001":4779736,"NAME":"Alabama","state":"01"},
 {"P0010001":2915918,"NAME":"Arkansas","state":"05"},
 {"P0010001":6392017,"NAME":"Arizona","state":"04"},
 {"P0010001":37253956,"NAME":"California","state":"06"}]
```

i.e. vector of key-value format - focus is on individual rows in a data set, whereas R puts emphasis on individual columns (data set is list of vectors).

advantage: enables streaming data, i.e new observations can easily be added as they become available

disadvantage: operations across observations are tricky

# Your Turn

The package `jsonlite` (part of the `tidyverse`) has functions `toJSON` and `fromJSON` to transform between JSON data and R objects. 

- convert the first three observations from data `mtcars` into JSON format (use `pretty = TRUE` to make things readable)

- copy the five lines from the previous slides into a character object. Use `fromJSON` to create an R object from it. What object do you get?

# Your Turn - Hard

The Census Bureau provides access to some of its data through an API, which returns json (like) data.

The call `https://api.census.gov/data/2010/surname?get=NAME,COUNT&RANK=1:100` returns values for surname and counts for the top 100 rank surnames of the 2010 surname table.

```
[["NAME","COUNT","RANK"],
["ADAMS","427865","42"],
["ALLEN","482607","33"],
["ALVAREZ","233983","92"],
["ANDERSON","784404","15"],
["BAILEY","277845","72"],
["BAKER","419586","44"],
...
]
```

Change the above call to include additional data on demographics (see [variables for surname data](api.census.gov/data/2010/surname/variables.html)) and read it into your R session.  

Is your last name included? At what rank? what is the change in rank since 2000?

---

```{r}
jsonlite::toJSON(mtcars[1:2,], pretty=TRUE)
```

---

```{r}
char <- '[{"P0010001":710231,"NAME":"Alaska","state":"02"},
 {"P0010001":4779736,"NAME":"Alabama","state":"01"},
 {"P0010001":2915918,"NAME":"Arkansas","state":"05"},
 {"P0010001":6392017,"NAME":"Arizona","state":"04"},
 {"P0010001":37253956,"NAME":"California","state":"06"}]'

str(jsonlite::fromJSON(char))
```
---

```{r}
query <- "https://api.census.gov/data/2010/surname?get=NAME,COUNT,PCTWHITE,PCTBLACK,PCTHISPANIC&RANK=1:100"

surnames <- jsonlite::fromJSON(query)

head(surnames, 10)
```

result is a matrix - it will need some work to turn into a data frame

# Navel gazing

```{r}
us2010 <- jsonlite::fromJSON("https://api.census.gov/data/2010/surname?get=NAME,COUNT,RANK,PCTWHITE,PCTBLACK&NAME=HOFMANN&NAME=VANDERPLAS")
us2000 <- jsonlite::fromJSON("https://api.census.gov/data/2000/surname?get=NAME,COUNT,RANK,PCTWHITE,PCTBLACK&NAME=HOFMANN&NAME=VANDERPLAS")

## "Awkward" text formats and R

The National Climate Data Center at NOAA publishes information on temperature and precipation across a network of stations in the US.

The Data can be accessed through ftp at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5, a code book with a description of the data structure is available at
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/readme.txt

```{r}
temp.all<-readLines("../data/USH00132999.raw.tmax", n = 5)
temp.all
```

# Fixed width format

- Fixed formats can be read with `read.fwf()` or `readr::read_fwf()`

- Need to specify column positions: pretty painful to specify

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
temps <- read_fwf("../data/USH00132999.raw.tmax",
  col_positions = fwf_positions(
    start=c( 1,13, rep(16+9*0:11, each=4) + c(1,7,8,9)), 
    end  =c(11,16, rep(16+9*0:11, each=4) + c(6,7,8,9))))
names(temps) <- c("Station", "Year", 
  paste0(rep(c("Value","DMflag", "QCflag", "DSflag"), 12), 
         rep(1:12, each=4)))
```


---

# Fort Dodge temps

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height =4}
FortDodge <- temps %>% 
  gather(key="Month", value="Temp_Max", starts_with("Value"))
FortDodge$Month <- as.numeric(gsub("Value", "", FortDodge$Month))
FortDodge$Temp_Max <- replace(FortDodge$Temp_Max, 
                              FortDodge$Temp_Max == -9999, NA)

FortDodge %>% filter(Temp_Max > -100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, Temp_Max/100)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Month, nrow=2) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

# USHCN network
  
  Parsing the information available in the file `ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt` was part of lab 1. This file is also in fixed width format:
  
  ```
----------------------------------------
  Variable             Columns    Type
----------------------------------------
COUNTRY CODE             1-2    Character
NETWORK CODE               3    Character
ID PLACEHOLDERS ("00")   4-5    Character
COOP ID                 6-11    Character
LATITUDE               13-20    Real
LONGITUDE              22-30    Real

-----------------------------------------
  ```

## First look at the data
  
```{r}
stations<-readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials/master/data/ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt", n = 5)
head(stations)
```

---
  
# reading the fixed width format 
  
```{r message=FALSE,  warning = FALSE}
stations <- read_fwf("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials-2019/master/labs/ushcn-v2.5-stations.txt",
                     col_positions = fwf_positions(
                       start=c(1,3,4,6,13,22,33,39,42,73,80,87,94), 
                       end  =c(2,3,5,11,20,30,37,40,71,78,85,92,95)))
# check that the formats are correct
stations %>% glimpse()

```

---
  
# Cleaning the data
  
We need to get the names in:
  
```{r}
names(stations) <- c("Country code", "Network code", "ID", "Coop ID",
                     "Latitude", "Longitude", "Elevation", "State",
                     "Name", "Comp1", "Comp2", "Comp3", "UTC offset")
```

Which Iowa stations do we have?
  
```{r}
stations[stations$State == "IA",]$Name
```    

---
  
Now we plot:
  
```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
us <- map_data("state")
stations <- stations %>% mutate(
  Elevation = as.numeric(Elevation)
)
stations %>% ggplot(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  geom_path(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), data = us) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Elevation, colour = factor(`UTC offset`)), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size(range=c(0.5, 3.5)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

There are some stations with wrong(?) UTC offsets

# HTML FILES 
  
  - A lot of data is available online in the form of html tables

- Extracting the data requires recognizing the html table format, and stripping off the html

- Packages such as `xml`, `rvest`, ... helps with this

---
  
# HTML FILES 
  
  Pulling election results off the web...

```{r warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/iowa-house-district-4"
doc <- read_html(url)
tables <- html_table(doc, fill=TRUE)
head(tables[[2]])
```


---
  
# Other binary formats and R
  
  - Packages `foreign` or `haven`: Data export/import for other (statistical) software: Stata, Epi, Octave, SPSS, Systat, SAS

- Package `readxl` import/export with Excel spreadsheets
e.g. web index data at http://www.visualizing.org/datasets/web-index-2013


---
  
# Why do we need to access all these formats? 
  
  - To solve a problem, may need to collate data from multiple sources

- Rearranging and merging data from different sources helps to pull together the data necessary to solve the problem
